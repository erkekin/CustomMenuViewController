# CustomMenuViewController
A custom replacement of UIMenuViewController with Swift 3

I used popover to replace UIMenuViewController over a UITextField.
Once some text is selected in the textView, a popover shows up. 
Can be customizable and provides some neat approach of getting the selected range rectangle.

You can use all for free.
